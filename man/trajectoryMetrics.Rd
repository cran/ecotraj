\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{\link{trajectories}}.}

\item{relativeToInitial}{Flag to indicate that lengths or angles should be calculated with respect to initial survey.}

\item{all}{A flag to indicate that angles are desired for all triangles (i.e. all pairs of segments) in the trajectory. If FALSE, angles are calculated for consecutive segments only.}

\item{xy}{Matrix with 2D coordinates in a Cartesian space (typically an ordination of ecosystem states).}

\item{sites}{A vector indicating the site corresponding to each ecosystem state.}

\item{surveys}{A vector indicating the survey corresponding to each ecosystem state (only necessary when surveys are not in order).}

\item{times}{A numeric vector indicating the time corresponding to each ecosystem state.}

\item{stats}{A flag to indicate that circular statistics are desired (mean, standard deviation and mean resultant length, i.e. rho)}

\item{add}{Flag to indicate that constant values should be added (local transformation) to correct triplets of distance values that do not fulfill the triangle inequality.}

\item{betweenSegments}{Flag to indicate that angles should be calculated between trajectory segments or with respect to X axis.}

\item{nperm}{The number of permutations to be used in the directionality test.}

\value{
Functions \code{trajectoryLengths} and  \code{trajectoryLengths2D} return a data frame with the length of each segment on each trajectory and the total length of all trajectories.
If \code{relativeToInitial = TRUE} lengths are calculated between the initial survey and all the other surveys.
If \code{all = TRUE} lengths are calculated for all segments.

Functions \code{trajectorySpeeds} and \code{trajectorySpeeds2D} return a data frame with the speed of each segment on each trajectory and the total speeds of all trajectories. Units depend on the units of distance matrix and the units of \code{times} of the input trajectory data.

Function \code{trajectoryAngles} returns a data frame with angle values on each trajectory. If \code{stats=TRUE}, then the mean, standard deviation and mean resultant length of those angles are also returned.

Function \code{trajectoryAngles2D} returns a data frame with angle values on each trajectory. If \code{betweenSegments=TRUE}, then angles are calculated between trajectory segments, alternatively, If \code{betweenSegments=FALSE}, angles are calculated considering Y axis as the North (0°).

Function \code{trajectoryDirectionality} returns a vector with directionality values (one per trajectory). If \code{nperm} is not missing, the function returns a data frame
with a column of directional values and a column of p-values corresponding to the result of the permutational test.

Function \code{trajectoryVariability} returns a vector with total variability values (one per trajectory).

Function \code{trajectoryMetrics} returns a data frame where rows are trajectories and columns are different trajectory metrics.

Function \code{trajectoryWindowMetrics} returns a data frame where rows are midpoints over trajectories and columns correspond to different trajectory metrics.

\details{
Ecological Trajectory Analysis (ETA) is a framework to analyze dynamics of ecosystems described as trajectories in a chosen space of multivariate resemblance (De \enc{Cáceres}{Caceres} et al. 2019).
ETA takes trajectories as objects to be analyzed and compared geometrically.

The input distance matrix \code{d} should ideally be metric. That is, all subsets of distance triplets should fulfill the triangle inequality (see utility function \code{\link{is.metric}}).
All ETA functions that require metricity include a parameter '\code{add}', which by default is TRUE, meaning that whenever the triangle inequality is broken the minimum constant required to fulfill it is added to the three distances.
If such local (an hence, inconsistent across triplets) corrections are not desired, users should find another way modify \code{d} to achieve metricity, such as PCoA, metric MDS or non-metric MDS (see vignette 'Introduction to Ecological Trajectory Analysis').
If parameter '\code{add}' is set to FALSE and problems of triangle inequality exist, ETA functions may provide missing values in some cases where they should not.

Function \code{trajectoryAngles} calculates angles between consecutive segments in degrees. For each pair of segments, the angle between the two is defined on the plane that contains the two segments, and measures the change in direction (in degrees) from one segment to the other.
Angles are always positive, with zero values indicating segments that are in a straight line, and values equal to 180 degrees for segments that are in opposite directions. If \code{all = TRUE}
angles are calculated between the segments corresponding to all ordered triplets. Alternatively, if \code{relativeToInitial = TRUE} angles are calculated for each segment with respect to the initial survey.

Function \code{trajectoryAngles2D} calculates angles between consecutive segments in degrees from 2D coordinates given as input. For each pair of segments, the angle between the two is defined on the plane that contains the two segments, and measures the change in direction (in degrees) from one segment to the other.
Angles are always positive (O to 360), with zero values indicating segments that are in a straight line, and values equal to 180 degrees for segments that are in opposite directions.
If \code{all = TRUE} angles are calculated between the segments corresponding to all ordered triplets. Alternatively, if \code{relativeToInitial = TRUE} angles are calculated for each segment with respect to the initial survey.
If \code{betweenSegments = TRUE} angles are calculated between segments of trajectory, otherwise, If \code{betweenSegments = FALSE}, angles are calculated considering Y axis as the North (0°).

Function \code{trajectoryDirectionality} evaluates the directionality metric proposed in De \enc{Cáceres}{Caceres} et al (2019). If \code{nperm} is supplied, then the function
performs a permutational test to evaluate the significance of directionality, where the null hypothesis entails a random order of surveys within each trajectory. The p-value corresponds to the proportion of
permutations with a directional value equal or larger than the observed.
